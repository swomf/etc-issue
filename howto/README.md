## What is my workflow?

As of now I am simply editing ANSI art (not as restricted as
ascii art) using `neovim` and basic 8-color tty-friendly
ANSI escape sequences.

On the left terminal, I run `neovim art/something`.

On the right, I run `./test art/something`.

Once I'm done I discuss the source, and my changes, in `art/.something`.

## Any other tips?

Run `./test howto/00any-of-the-files-here` for useful references.
